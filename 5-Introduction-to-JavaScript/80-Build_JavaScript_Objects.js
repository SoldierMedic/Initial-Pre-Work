// in this lesson I was intstructed to create an object in JS. I learned that JS will auto type cast all properties to strings if not specified.
// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  name: "Oreo",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything"]




};
