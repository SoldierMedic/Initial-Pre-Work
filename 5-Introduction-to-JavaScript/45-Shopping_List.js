// in this lesson we made a shopping list multi-dimensional array. I organized it in a way that used to make it easier for me to understand where rows vs columns are in a multi-dimensional array.
var myList =[["Chocolate Bar", 15],
             ["Fruit Cup", 5],
             ["Water", 100],
             ["Soda" , 50],
             ["Juice", 20]];
