// in this lesson I learned that you can use the += operator on strings similarly to how it's used with numbers.
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
